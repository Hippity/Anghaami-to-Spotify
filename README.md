# Anghami-to-Spotify
This code will transfer your songs from Anghami to Spotify

The code works by entering how many playlists you have on the Anghami code. The code will then make a file for each playlist and save your songs onto them.

The next step is to go on the Spotify code and enter your file name and let your computer rest as the computer will run a script to save and add each song into your playlist.

This is not the most efficient solution however its better than doing it manually. 

You must enter on the Spotify and Anghami code your email and password as well as your chromedriver path where indicated.
